arduino internet button code for sunrise alarm

## TODO
  Some things that are on the list to finish still.

  * lights should gradually come on towards alarm/wakeup time
    * use a yellow linear ramp for now
    * look up how to get a log ramp through color temp to white

  * scanning the wemo devices should update the catalog instead of
    replacing the whole thing like it does now

  * some web requests seem slow

  * upnp client support -- should show up as a virtual wemo device

  * multiple virtual clients
